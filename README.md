## Summary
The current diploma thesis addresses the visualization and analysis of indicator data. Data visualization employs various visualization techniques, including different types of charts such as line charts or bar charts, as well as other techniques like tables or maps. One of the techniques used for data analysis is clustering, accomplished through a machine learning algorithm known as k-means. The means of user interaction is a website. Indicator data were sourced from CSV files, modified, and stored in a database. With the assistance of a server, these data are then presented on the website in an appropriate format.

## Usage
Interaction with the data is facilitated through a website. Data is sourced from CSV files, modified, and stored in a database. The website provides visualization and clustering of data, allowing researchers and business professionals to draw conclusions for the selected indices.

## Technologies Used

### Database - MySQL
For the storage and retrieval of data, MySQL was employed as the relational database management system. Its robust capabilities in handling structured data made it an ideal choice for efficiently managing and organizing the dataset.

### Frontend Framework - React
React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, was utilized for the frontend development of the thesis project. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM mechanism provided a responsive and dynamic user experience.

### Framework - Spring Boot
Spring Boot, a framework for building Java-based enterprise applications, served as the backend foundation. Its simplicity and convention-over-configuration approach facilitated rapid development, enabling seamless integration with the frontend, efficient data processing, and the incorporation of machine learning models.

### Machine Learning - scikit-learn (sklearn)
Scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python, played a crucial role in the analysis phase of the project. Its versatile set of tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more allowed for the implementation of machine learning models, enhancing the depth of data analysis.

### Data Source - Our World in Data
All data used in this thesis project was sourced from Our World in Data. This reputable platform provided a rich and comprehensive dataset, ensuring the project's reliance on accurate and up-to-date information.

### Data Visualization - Google Charts
Google Charts played a pivotal role in visualizing the dataset. Leveraging a variety of chart types such as line charts, bar charts, and maps, Google Charts enhanced the presentation of complex data patterns, enabling clear and insightful data analysis.

The synergy of MySQL, React, Spring Boot, scikit-learn, Google Charts, and the data from Our World in Data in this thesis project not only provided a robust technological stack but also contributed to the creation of a dynamic and visually engaging platform for the analysis and visualization of index data, incorporating machine learning for enhanced insights.
